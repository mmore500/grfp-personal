%Ant colonies regulate their foraging behavior through a collective decision making process; when ants forage, no individual ant operates with complete information about the terrain they are exploring.
% This contrasts with traditional human approaches decision-making, which typically centralize information, process it, then redistribute instructions.
% Consider, for example, traffic-aware navigation tools such as Waze or Google Maps; the distribution of traffic distribution across a geographic region is collected from users, centrally processed, and then routing instructions are redistributed to individual users.
% In contrast, collective intelligence on the level of the ant colony emerges from parallel execution of a simple set of individual pheromone deposit and response behaviors; among other feats, foraging ants will tend to to choose the shortest path between nest and food and to selectively exploit the richest of an array of food sources.
