\underline{\smash{\textit{\textbf{Broader Impacts}}}}
I built relationships with high school and college students as \textbf{a subject tutor, an academic consultant, an AP tutor, a classroom assistant, a musical coach, and an after-school club leader}.
In these capacities, I worked with high school and college students on a weekly basis over three and a half years.
Today, I see my relationships with other students among the most important accomplishments of my undergraduate career.
In particular, I was caught off guard by an alternative high school student I tutored in math.
Out of the blue, she asked, ``What's so great about college?''
I almost launched into why \textit{I} liked college, but instead asked, ``What's your favorite thing to talk about?''
She took a moment, then replied, ''Books, I guess.''
``What's so cool,'' I told her, ``is that you can take classes in whatever you want.
You can take classes about stories with other people who love them too.''
She took notice when I mentioned how well she would get along with my humanities friends.
This experience made me realize that \textbf{making a personal connection and sharing my enthusiasm is more important than dispensing advice} and inspired me to \textbf{lead a mentoring initiative} in my senior year.
I recruited mentors to lead small groups of underclassmen in computer science activities to develop social connections between class cohorts build skills like professional networking and programming in IDEs.
We organized three department-funded meet-ups, each attended by approximately fifteen students.

By showing me the difference \textit{I} can make, my outreach work led me to set out making higher education and STEM more welcoming and accessible as a key priority of my scientific career.
My experience as a LGBT person has deepened my perspective on barriers to inclusivity in the scientific community.
I believe identity is not baggage to be checked at the door but must be recognized and respected.
Although the barriers I have encountered pale in comparison to those faced by others, I work to leverage these molehills to reach out over mountains.
