\underline{\smash{\textit{\textbf{Broader Impacts}}}}
I developed educational outreach skills as \textbf{a subject tutor, an academic consultant, an AP tutor, a classroom assistant, a musical coach, and an after-school club leader}.
In these capacities, I worked with high school and college students on a weekly basis over three and a half years.
I see these mentoring relationships among the most important accomplishments of my undergraduate career.
I was caught off guard by an alternative high school student I tutored in math who, out of the blue, asked, ``What's so great about college?''
I almost launched into why \textit{I} liked college, but instead asked, ``What's your favorite thing to talk about?''
She took a moment, then replied, ``Books, I guess.''
``What's so cool,'' I told her, ``is that you can take classes in whatever you want.
You can take classes about literature with other people who love books too.''
She took notice when I mentioned how well she would get along with my humanities friends.
This experience made me realize the impact of making a personal connection and showing a student they belong.
I went on to \textbf{lead a CS mentoring initiative} in my senior year.
We organized three department-funded meet-ups to develop social connections between class cohorts and build skills like professional networking and programming in IDEs.
Each was attended by approximately fifteen students.

By showing me the difference \textit{I} can make, my outreach work
led me to define making higher education and STEM more welcoming and accessible as a key priority of my scientific career.
As an LGBT person, I know that identity is not baggage to be checked at the door.
I believe recognizing and respecting diversity makes STEM stronger.
I strive to use my own experiences to reach across barriers to inclusivity experienced by others in the scientific community.
