\underline{\smash{\textit{\textbf{Career Goals}}}}
My current research interests stem directly from my undergraduate thesis and capstone work.
\textbf{I am pursing a doctoral degree with Dr. Charles Ofria at BEACON}, an NSF Science and Technology Center for the Study of Evolution in Action at Michigan State University.
BEACON offers access to \textbf{high performance computing resources} and a \textbf{uniquely interdisciplinary research community}.
Working with biologists on \textit{in vivo} work and with evolutionary computing practitioners will allow me to apply novel biological concepts to evolutionary computing.
In particular, I am interested in understanding what critical nuances are missing from simple algorithmic implementations of evolution built on bare bones selection, variation, and inheritance;
my specific focus is on \textbf{evolvability and environmental influence on the phenotype}.
Understanding these phenomena will help biologists answer questions about the evolution of complex traits like human intelligence and will help evolutionary computing researchers develop powerful applied evolution techniques to solve practical problems like automating deep learning architecture design.

By probing the algorithmic principles of biology, I hope to contribute to the \textbf{development of more capable, versatile AI systems} with direct human impact.
I am inspired by my father, who volunteers for Dial-A-Bus to serve individuals whose disabilities would otherwise limit their ability to fully participate in the community.
I hope that, through applications that counteract disability and free us from dangerous or simply menial tasks, stronger AI will enable people to more fully exercise their human capabilities.
My work with the Swarm lab, with Dr. Chambers, and in the Ofria lab helps lay the groundwork for this future.
I will leverage my outreach skills build industrial collaborations that apply my research to real-world AI problems.

I am committed to \textbf{continuing to foster community among scientists and perform STEM outreach}.
I currently volunteer four hours a week as a teacher's assistant in special and general education classrooms in East Lansing.
In my third period classroom, my work is specially targeted at engaging minority students.
As I progress in my graduate studies, I look forward to welcoming new graduate students and taking advantage of BEACON funding support to mentor undergraduates on summer research projects.

Ultimately, I aspire to lead an academic research group and build an inclusive community that will allow us to accomplish our outreach, technological, and scientific goals.
GRFP support will help me \textbf{conduct cutting edge research at the intersection of biology and computer science} and lead in the conversation about the intrinsic value of \textbf{outreach, mentorship, and community in science}.
