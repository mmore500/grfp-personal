\textbf{Conclusion}
My affiliation with BEACON provides a strong foundation for my graduate career goals.
BEACON provides many opportunities for collaborations across disciplines and institutions.
GRFP funding will provide a strong position to act on relationships with science and industry collaborators.
In graduate school, I want to facilitate similar experiences for other students through near-peer mentoring relationships.
BEACON provides resources --- particularly, summer research funding for undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds --- to support these relationships.
I will invest time and resources made available by GRFP support into mentoring relationships and STEM outreach.
GRFP support will help me not only conduct cutting edge research at the intersection of biology and computer science, but also to lead in the conversation about the intrinsic value of outreach, education, mentorship, and community in science.
