Ultimately, I see continuing in academic research to lead a research group as the best route to build the type of community I have enjoyed belonging to and accomplish my outreach, technological, and scientific goals.
GRFP support will help me not only conduct cutting edge research at the intersection of biology and computer science, but also to lead in the conversation about the intrinsic value of outreach, education, mentorship, and community in science.
