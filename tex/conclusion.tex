Ultimately, I aspire to lead an academic research group and build an inclusive community that will allow me and others to accomplish our outreach, technological, and scientific goals.
GRFP support will help me \textbf{conduct cutting edge research at the intersection of biology and computer science} an lead in the conversation about the intrinsic value of \textbf{outreach, education, mentorship, and community in science}.
