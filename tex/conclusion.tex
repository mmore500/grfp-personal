%\subsection{How NSF GRFP funding would help}
GRFP funding would support the aspects of my graduate career I care the most about.
I remain strongly committed to continuing to work with and get to know younger students, particularly those without the opportunity to fully exercise their capabilities --- scientific, artistic, and otherwise.
My association with the NSF BEACON Center for the study of evolution in action provides many routes to connect with students through scientific outreach.
I am impressed by the dedication my peers at the Center exhibit in this regard.
I aim to both contribute directly to this potential, as an outreach participant, and help provide an outlet for it, as an organizer.
The stabile support provided by GRFP funding would directly facilitate these goals.
GRFP funding would also enrich the bedrock of my graduate career: the idea to vision to results pipeline.
In graduate school, I care deeply about playing an active role in directing my own efforts.
Funding would guarantee a fundamental intellectual freedom to aim towards important and ambitious ends.
My field --- particularly the BEACON community --- is rife with opportunities for collaborations across disciplinary and institutional boundaries.
GRFP funding would a provide priveleged position to develop and tap these relationships.
As I begin my graduate career, I am grateful for the privelege to jump headfirst into the intersection of computing and evolution.
NSF GRFP support would help me to hit the ground running.
