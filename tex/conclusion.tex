\textbf{Conclusion}
My affiliation with BEACON provides a strong foundation for the goals I have laid out for my graduate career.
BEACON provides many opportunities for collaborations across disciplines and institutions.
I am particularly interested in collaborating with biologists to perform wet work to better understand what properties of the genotype-phenotype mapping facilitate evolution and working with hardware/electrical engineers to explore distributed system design for swarm computing.
GRFP funding would provide a strong position to develop and take advantage of relationships with science and industry collaborators.
In graduate school, I want to facilitate similar experiences for other students through near-peer mentoring relationships.
BEACON provides opportunities, particularly summer research funding for dozens of undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds, to develop these relationships.
I will invest time and resources made available by GRFP support into these relationships.
GRFP support will help me not only conduct cutting edge research at the intersection of biology and computer science, but also to lead in the conversation about the intrinsic value of outreach, education, mentorship, and community in science.
