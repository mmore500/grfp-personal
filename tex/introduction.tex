In sixth grade, I was up late to glue tiny beads from my family's junk drawer onto the cardboard cell model that I had traced out.
While I struggled place the small plastic pieces onto my model, I also struggled to cobble together the simplistic descriptions of organelles we had learned into an understanding of the cellular whole.
Because every piece of the cell depends on others, I felt I could not truly understand any piece in isolation.
That experience stoked a glimmer of curiosity that grew into a love of thinking about and experimenting with abstractions of the \textbf{astonishing structures and mechanisms embedded at every level of biological organization}.
Today, \textbf{computational experiments} are my vehicle for this endeavor.

When I started to develop an interest in biology, I also began playing the oboe.
Like science, band culture is built on \textbf{mentoring relationships, cooperative competition, and friendly warmth between peers}.
Without this community, we could not develop extensive technical skills, push ourselves to do our best work, and accomplish goals far beyond the capabilities of any single individual.
I am drawn to the willingness to invest, the high expectations, and the mutual respect scientists and musicians hold for their kind.
These pervasive values inspired me to pursue a career in science.

As a scientist, I aspire
(1) to \textbf{develop fundamental theory and applications for bio-inspired approaches to artificial intelligence} and
(2) to \textbf{promote an inclusive and intellectually vibrant scientific community through mentoring relationships and STEM education}.
